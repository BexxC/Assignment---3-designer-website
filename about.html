<p class="about-info">Maguy Lee born on May 10, 1965, in Taichung City, Taiwan, she was raised by her parents Cheng Lee and Su Jen Lin, who both worked as chemistry professors at Taipei Medical University (TMU). She grew up with one younger brother, Yangzhe Li. Throughout her life, she has found joy in various forms of art, particularly drawing, of dolls growing up. With that, she pursued fashion design. For over 30 years until she moved to Canada, where she became an art teacher, with her own private studio. She developed a deep appreciation for nature, especially trees. The trajectory of her life has taken her across continents, from her homeland in Taiwan, including Taichung City and Taipei City, to France, where she resided in Angers and Paris for her studies, and finally to Canada with her family, with stays in Mississauga before moving to Richmond in 2010. This diverse array of experiences has undoubtedly enriched her perspective and creativity, shaping her into the individual she is today. </p>
